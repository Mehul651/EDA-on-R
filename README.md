# EDA-on-R

This repositories covers two sub projects:
Part 1 Most popular names (babyname)#: The target was to load the babynames tibble. Use dplyr to find out which were the three most popular names given to babies of male sex during the 20th century (1900-1999) in the USA. 
Use ggplot2 to produce a singlegraph that shows how the popularity these three names changed over the course of the century. 

Part 2 Data exploration (EVcars)#: In this I have chosen a EVcars dataset and done a Exploratory Data Analysis on it. The main target learning here was to make use of R tidyverse (including dplyr and ggplot2) to extract relevant data,compute descriptive statistics, and visualise variable distributions and relationships between variables using appropriate graphical techniques.

I have also put a report file which describes in detail about both the projects including the dataset and each line of code.
